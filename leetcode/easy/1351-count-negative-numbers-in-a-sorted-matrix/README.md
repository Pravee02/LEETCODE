# Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return  *the number of  **negative**  numbers in*  `grid`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- -100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

 

 **Follow up:**  Could you find an `O(n + m)` solution?

        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < grid.length ; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[i].length ;j++)
            {
                if(grid[i][j] < 0 )
                {
                    count += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
